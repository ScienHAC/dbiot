# App Icon Setup Instructions

## What we've done:
1. ✅ Added flutter_launcher_icons package to pubspec.yaml
2. ✅ Added configuration for app icon generation
3. ✅ Created assets/icon folder

## What you need to do:

### Step 1: Create the app icon image
You need to create a 1024x1024 PNG image of your pill + plus sign logo and save it as:
`assets/icon/app_icon.png`

**Icon Design:**
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels
- Background: Blue (#2196F3) 
- Main icon: White pill/medication icon in center
- Plus sign: Green (#4CAF50) circle with white plus, positioned top-right
- Format: PNG with transparency if needed

### Step 2: Install the package and generate icons
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install the new package
flutter pub get

# Generate all app icon sizes
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

### Step 3: Rebuild your app
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter build apk
```

## Alternative: Quick Creation Method

If you want me to help create the icon file, I can:
1. Create a simple Flutter app that renders your logo
2. Take a screenshot/export as PNG
3. Save it to the correct location

Would you like me to proceed with creating the icon file programmatically?

## Expected Result:
After following these steps, your app icon on the phone's home screen will show the same pill + plus sign logo that appears inside your app, instead of the default Flutter logo.
